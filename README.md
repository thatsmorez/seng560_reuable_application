## Information
This repository contains an example application which utilizes a reuable library created by a student in WVU's SENG 560 course. The example application is written in python and uses https://github.com/zroberts/seng560-python-math as the reusable library.


## How to use the application
	- Clone the application repository by typing *git clone https://github.com/thatsmorez/seng560_reuable_application* into the command line
	- Change directory into the cloned repositary *cd seng560_reuable_application*
	-  Cloned the application library by typing *git clone https://github.com/zroberts/seng560-python-math*  into the command line
	- Run the application by python *python reuse_application.py* into the command line
		- follow all prompts to execute the application


## Experience with working with the library
Using the  https://github.com/zroberts/seng560-python-math library was very straight forward and as such I was able to reuse it as black box to create my python calculator application. Honestly, my only difficulties was figuring out how to tell my computer where the library was located.
